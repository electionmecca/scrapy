#  A Few Scrapy Projects

## Beginnings of Some Hefty Scraping
* This is my collection of web scraping projects, right now entirely through the Scrapy framework.
* Currently all the projects are other people's work, though there will be personalized touches in the future. The project is almost entirely via Scrapy regardless.
* All scraped websites will be with the aim of gathering data for the still-fetal [Election Mecca](http://electionmecca.com), which will primarily focus on polical prediction market data.

## Future Scraping Aspirations
* My current aim is the betting odds aggregator [Oddschecker](http://www.oddschecker.com/politics/us-politics/us-presidential-election-2016/republican-candidate). Future websites will likely include [PredictIt](http://predictit.org), [Betfair](https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/#/politics/market/1.107373419), and some choice bitcoin-based prediction markets.
